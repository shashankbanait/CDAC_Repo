of completion of any task, but we need to manage session by web application

Session management: 
since web application uses http protocol and by default this protocol is stateless protocol.
it means it does not maintain the state of client, so for maintaining the state of client,
we need to manage the session

1) URL rewriting    ---
2) Hidden field         |       these three are client side
3) cookies        ----- |
4) session API                  // this is server side
